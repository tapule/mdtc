# MegaDrive Toolchain
A Linux m68k toolchain for MegaDrive development.

## Toolchain
This Makefile will download and build the following packages:
- Binutils 2.43.1
- GCC (m68k-elf) 14.2.0
- GDB 15.1
- SJasm 0.39
- Siktools master branch
- MDTools main branch
- Blastem tip tag (Nightly equivalent)
- Newlib main branch

Packages are pulled from their own mirrors or git repositories:
- https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu
- https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure (GCC, GDB)
- https://sourceware.org/git/newlib-cygwin.git (Newlib)
- https://github.com/konamiman/sjasm
- https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/mdtools
- https://github.com/tapule/mdtools
- https://www.retrodev.com/repos/blastem
- https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL (Blastem)
- https://github.com/nigels-com/glew (Blastem)

There are some other dependencies needed to build some packages from the toolchain: `gcc, tar, wget, git, mercurial, libasound2-dev, libpulse-dev, libpng-dev`. Please check out your package manager's documentation to install them.

## Building
To build the toolchain run:
- `make`

By default, the toolchain will be built only with C language support, but you can specify other languages by overriding `LANGS` makefile variable:
- `make LANGS=c,c++`

Newlib is not built by default. You can build it with:
- `make with-newlib`

## Installation
To install the toolchain run:
- `make install`

This will compile and install the toolchain by default to `toolchain` directory. You can specify the installation directory by overriding `INSTALL_DIR` makefile variable:
- `make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/toolchain`

Maybe you want to add the toolchain's path to your environment PATH:
- `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/toolchain/bin:/path/to/toolchain/blastem`
